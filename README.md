# D2RL
Official PyTorch code for D2RL: Deep Dense Architectures in Reinforcement Learning

Paper: 

The code includes the code to train SAC-D2RL, TD3-D2RL, and CURL-D2RL agents. 

***If there are any questions related to the code, email at: samarth.sinha@mail.utoronto.ca***

To try D2RL on other environments, or with other algorithms, the main parameters to be tuned are the learning rate of the actors and critics. We also include a pseudo-code in the main paper. Kindly let us know if there are any questions.

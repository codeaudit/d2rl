Paper: 

The code includes the code to train SAC, TD3 and CURL agents. 

***If there are any questions related to the code, email me at: samarth.sinha@mail.utoronto.ca***

To try the D2RL on any different environments, the parameters that can be tuned are the learning rate of the actors and critics.

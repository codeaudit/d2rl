# D2RL
Official PyTorch code for D2RL: Deep Dense Architectures in Reinforcement Learning

***Paper***: http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09163

***Blog***: https://sites.google.com/view/d2rl/home

The code includes the code to train SAC-D2RL, TD3-D2RL, and CURL-D2RL agents. 

***If there are any issues or questions related to the code, send an email at: samarth.sinha@mail.utoronto.ca***

To try D2RL on other environments, the main parameters to be tuned are the learning rate of the actors and critics. To try D2RL with other algorithms, we also include a pseudo-code for the architecture changes in the main paper. Kindly let us know if there are any questions.

Installation details, dependencies, and instructions for training are included in the individual sub-folders.
